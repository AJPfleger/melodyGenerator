# melodyGenerator
A simple programme to create melodies with a desired pitch.

This programme can help to train your pitch. In an easy way you can create melodies. Those melodies then can be transposed to different keys and be exported as a .wav-file.

## How To Use
To train your pitch you need to:
1. Create your own melody (or use one of the predefined ones).
2. Find define your vocal range:
  * `fLow` is the lowest frequency you are able to sing
  * `fCenter` is the frequency you are able to sing most comfortably
  * `fHigh` is the highest frequency you are able to sing
3. Generate the .wav-file, with all possible transpositions of the melody within your vocal range
4. Play the .wav-file, pause after each snippet and try to sing it.
5. (Optional) You can use an app like (Nail the pitch)[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autumnrockdev.nailthepitch] to check if you are hitting the notes correctly. (Please someone check if this app is safe to use.)

## Future Goals
* Make it full comand line compatible
* Make the frequency-selection more intuitiv, e.g. by entering the name of the tone
* Generate better sounds for the generated instruments
* Write more melodies
